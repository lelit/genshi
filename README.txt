About Genshi
============

Genshi is a Python library that provides an integrated set of
components for parsing, generating, and processing HTML, XML or other
textual content for output generation on the web. The major feature is
a template language, which is heavily inspired by Kid.

For more information please see the documentation in the `doc`
directory, and visit the Genshi web site:

Python 3.x only version
-----------------------

This is actually a fork of the original Genshi library that targets
**only** Python 3.5 and up (maybe also 3.4, I didn't tried it).
